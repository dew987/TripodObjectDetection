# Problem Statement
Recycling facilities often have a large volume of waste to sort through, and manually sorting through this waste can be time-consuming and prone to errors. The problem is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately detect and classify different types of waste in images, such as plastic, paper, metal, etc. The goal is to create a model that can improve sorting efficiency and reduce the amount of waste sent to landfills.

# Process
The project will be implemented in Python with the use of appropriate libraries and cooperating tools. The user will enter in the console the path to the selected photo to be analysed. The analysis of the photo will consist of extracting objects from the photo and then identifying them according to the category of objects from the data set. The result of executing the user's command will be text feedback on the identified objects on the console. CNN(Convolutional Neutral Network) will be used in this process.
