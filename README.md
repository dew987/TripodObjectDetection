# Problem Statement
The aim of the project is to create an AI model that will analyse images passed by the user and then identify waste as belonging to one of the categories. The artificial intelligence model will learn to recognize waste category based on our data set. The categories included in the data set: cardboard, glass, paper, metal and plastic. 

# Process
The project will be implemented in Python with the use of appropriate libraries and cooperating tools. The user will enter in the console the path to the selected photo to be analysed. The analysis of the photo will consist of extracting objects from the photo and then identifying them according to the category of objects from the data set. The result of executing the user's command will be text feedback on the identified objects on the console. CNN(Convolutional Neutral Network) will be used in this process.
